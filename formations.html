                Formations are layers of rock distinct from those around them! The time they span can range wildly, but usually specimens are excavated from a few or just one site within a formation. This allows us to have a small glimpse into the environment of the dinosaurs found there, and what else they lived alongside. Here I have provided a few examples of some of the more well known or diverse formations, with dinosaurs you may have heard of.

                The Yixian formation is home to some of the best preserved dinosaur specimens ever, even being home to the largest known feathered dinosaur, Yutyrannus huali, and one of the most well known dinosaur genus ever, Psittacosaurus.
