                What is a Dinosaur? It's a word to define a group of animals that all evolved from one common ancestor. 
                This group includes the Ornithiscia, bird hipped dinosaurs (which does not include birds), and Saurischia, 
                lizard hipped dinosaurs (which does). And yes! Birds are dinosaurs! When people talk about the extinction of 
                the dinosaurs, it is technically only the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, as birds survived. 
                
                There are a couple key features that define them: Upright hips, allowing for a posture with their legs 
                below them. A phalange on the back of the femur, allowing for muscle attachments on the tail. There is 
                also a knee crest. The hips should also have a ball and socket joint.
